- Break up long paragraphs for better readability
- Use lists (like this one) to organize information

![Descriptive alt text for the image](/blog-images/your-image.jpg)

**Remember:**

- Place images in the `public/blog-images/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Always include alt text for accessibility

### Code Examples

If you need to include code snippets:

```javascript
// Example code block
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, ARC!");
}
```
