# Welcome to ARC!

We're thrilled to welcome you to the official website of **Advanced RMIT Combat-Robotics (ARC)** - a student-run engineering collective dedicated to building combat robots and inspiring hands-on innovation through technology, teamwork, and engineering excellence.

## What We Do

At ARC, we bring together passionate students from various engineering disciplines to design, build, and compete with combat robots. Our collective provides a unique opportunity to:

- **Learn by doing**: Get hands-on experience with mechanical design, electronics, programming, and fabrication
- **Build amazing robots**: Create powerful combat machines from concept to competition
- **Compete**: Test your designs in exciting robot combat events
- **Network**: Connect with like-minded engineers and industry professionals

## Our Mission

Our mission is to inspire innovation, foster collaboration, and provide a platform for students to apply their engineering knowledge in a fun and competitive environment. We believe that the best way to learn engineering is by building real, working machines that can withstand the rigors of combat.

## Getting Involved

Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just starting out, there's a place for you in ARC. We welcome students from all backgrounds and skill levels. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Join our meetings**: Come to our weekly club meetings to learn more
2. **Join a team**: Work with other members on building a combat robot
3. **Attend workshops**: Learn new skills in our hands-on workshops
4. **Compete**: Enter your robot in our internal competitions and external events
