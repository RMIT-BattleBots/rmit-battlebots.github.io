G'day everyone, we are pleased to present our newly improved version of our first 3lb bot _DAVE_, which we are naming _Fullmetal DAVE_. _Fullmetal DAVE_ is to be a vast improvement from its predecessor incorporating tougher materials, professionally manufactured components, improved fixtures and introducing new, fresh features.

## What Needed Improvement?

Our original design for 'DAVE' was met with several flaws, predominantly with the construct of its structure. These flaws were known prior to competition, but were made apparent during fights as it slowly, but surely, began falling apart. Nothing that a little bit of duct tape and zip ties couldn't fix.

However, this would come to bite us as these quick fixes compromised the accessibility of our design, preventing attempts at a quick maintenance if our bot ceased operation before a fight.

Accessibility had already been an existing issue, most severely were with its wheels. As the wheel guards around our wheels were fastened using bolts that also fastened the structure, the bot had to be partly taken apart when removing and attaching wheels.

Further issues were seen in the design of our wheel mounts, using a two part 3d printed design which enclosed the motor. In theory it was good, in practice however, it was met with many flaws which were amplified by the bots structural instability.

Before we created our new design, we needed to consider the following:

- How do we improve our current chassis?
- How do we improve our motor mounts?
- Can we improve our weapons?
- What can we remove/add/redesign?

## Where We’re At Currently

Taking from what we learnt with DAVE, we rebuilt the bot from the ground up opting for an asymmetric design which would allow us to raise our weapon higher or lower depending on which side we fight with.

The new design introduces an updated and structurally sound chassis incorporating both aluminium and UHMW-PE components, using folded sheet metal and plates to connect the UHMW-PE panels together. These components are planned to be manufactured by RMIT's awesome fabrication and manufacturing team over at RMIT's Bundoora campus.

Our previous motor brackets were both poorly designed and unnecessarily bulky. Taking inspiration from the bots of competitors from Melbourne Combat Robotics, we have designed a simple plate from aluminium which attaches to the shaft end of the motor and is fastened directly to our side panels. This is intended to keep our wheels properly aligned and provide better accessibility for maintenance.

By altering both the materials and chassis design, so to does the weight we have have access to. Originally, _DAVE_ just barely met the weight requirements of the 3lb beetleweight class. With _Fullmetal DAVE_ we have allowed for a buffer in its weight allowing us both flexibility and room to add additional features. A new feature we've designed are the inclusion of front folks, these will assist in both lifting opponents into our raised weapon but also get under those pesky horizontal spinners (we're talking about you _Underbite_).

And that's where we're at with _Fullmetal DAVE_, we plan to release more build logs not just for _Fullmetal DAVE_, but for our other bots in the works so stay tuned for those!
